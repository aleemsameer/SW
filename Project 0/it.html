They have become essential tools in engineering; and from database systems to internet search engines, they have become essential parts of modern software systems. And these are but a few examples as the scope of computer applications continues to grow. This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations which covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms.<br>

                                    <h2 id="list-6"><u>Databases</u></h2>
                                    <p>A database is an organized collection of data. A relational database, more restrictively, is a collection of schemas, tables, queries, reports, views, and other elements. Database designers typically organize the data to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as (for example) modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.
                                        A database-management system (DBMS) is a computer-software application that interacts with end-users, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS allows the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.
                                        A database is not generally portable across different DBMSs, but different DBMSs can interoperate by using standards such as SQL and ODBC or JDBC to allow a single application to work with more than one DBMS.<br>
                                        Course Learning outcomes:
By the end of this course, students will be able to: <br>
Define Relational Databases

                                    <p>The goal of this course is to lay a solid Software Engineering Foundation for graduate students moving into their final year of studies in the MSIT program. Programming skills are crucial, but producing workable code without industry standards is not sufficient. Professionals in the industry produce workable software products that seamlessly map design into code. A successful software professional must have many skills as well as a wealth of experience in order to predictably deliver quality products on time and within budget.<br>
                                        By the time the course is complete, you will be well equipped to:<br>
Understand the issues affecting the organization, planning, and control of software-based systems development, producing feedback, recommendations for improvement and brainstorming alternative solutions as required to earn the client's respect.
Complete the analysis, design, implementation, testing, integration, documentation and deployment of a small software-intensive system end to end;
Read and understand the professional and technical literature on software engineering as required to resolve an issue that is blocking the project's progress.

                                    <p>This course is fundamental to any computer science curriculum, but it is not just for programmers and computer-science students. Everyone who uses a computer wants it to run faster or to solve larger problems. The algorithms in this course represent a body of knowledge developed over the last 50 years that has become indispensable. Pairwise connections between items play a critical role in a vast array of computational applications. The relationships implied by these connections lead immediately to a host of natural questions: Is there a way to connect one item to another by following the connections? How many other items are connected to a given item? What is the shortest chain of connections between this item and this other item? To model such situations, we use abstract mathematical objects called graphs. In this course, we examine basic properties of graphs in detail, setting the stage for us to study a variety of algorithms that are useful for answering questions of the type just posed.We communicate by exchanging strings of characters. Accordingly, numerous important and familiar applications are based on processing strings. We consider classic algorithms for addressing the underlying computational challenges surrounding applications.<br>
                                        Learning Outcomes<br>

Describe the work flow of Google maps software works? How does it show you the way? Any idea? It is the Graph data structure inside.
Analyse the use of schedulers(process, task, application, etc). Don’t you? Besides implementing nice policy, what if it wastes a lot of time deciding on the task just because you organize the data in a wrong way.

Develop skills to apply appropriate data structures in problem solving.
Study the basic concepts in the specification and analysis of programs

                                    <p>Introduction to cyber security is a two week course offered to MSIT first year students for 2 credits. This course provides concepts behind security, along with hands on exercises to solve aspects around device level security, network host discovery, human behavioral attacks, privacy on online and social media, network security through pen testing, physical and personal security, and cryptographic primitives. Students are supposed to prepare cyber security awareness posters for their batchmates and society. Students also get to work on cryptography and public key certificates, along with tools that help them defend against most cyber attacks.<br>

                                        Learning objectives:<br>
                                        
                                        At the end of this course students will be able to:
                                        Apply host hardening for all the devices including laptop, tablet and mobiles.
                                        Make use of tools for network host discovery.
                                        Experiment with static code analysis tools.
                                        Outline behavioral attacks on Humans.
                                        Explain privacy in online and social media.
                                        Identify host vulnerabilities through penetration testing tools.
                                        Organize a toolkit for physical and personal security.
                                        Apply cryptographic primitives to achieve confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non repudiation.</p>
